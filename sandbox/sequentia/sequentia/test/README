By default, 1-based coordinate system is used.
By default, only the first sample in VCF file will be written to output file. (make sure first sample has all the variant to annotate!)

The third variant is a 2-bp deletion, with the observed nucleotides being represented by "-". 


1 11403596 11403596 - AT comments: rs35561142, a 2-bp insertion
The fourth variant is a 2-bp insertion, since the reference nucleotide in the reference genome is represented by “–”.
